Instructor Materials
=================

This directory contains files designed to aid the instructor in both
helping students complete the project as well as grading their
efforts. Therefore students are asked to avoid looking at the files in
this directory (although they will interact with some of them
indirectly to verify their progress through the exercises).

## Description of Files
* *teachers_guide.txt*: A copy of the project instructions with extra
hints and other info to dispense as necessary.
* *test_project.py*: A nose test suite designed to run unit tests on the
projects, both for students to run as they do the project and for
instructors to run to grade them.
